* Project Ideas
** TODO Create an emacs interface to googler
* TODO Improved elisp library for folders and strings
Create a small subset of the features in the python library in elisp and submit it to emacs
** Create a package which removes all modes from the line and lets the user invoke them in a temp list
The user must also be able to disable them, keep major mode only and add special rules for disabling them
