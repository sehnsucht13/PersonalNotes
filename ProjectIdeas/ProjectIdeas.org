** TODO  Improve CSSS discord bot
Currently the bot does not recognize something like:
~phil120~ but it does recognize something like ~phil120w~. To eliminate this,
we can easily try to access phil120 at first. If error then we append all the
postfixes. Finally, we need to deal with the issue of slop. This is the last
case and we can simply check if what is typed in is an anagram for one of
departments. Having too many letters might be solved in a similar
problem. Should be pretty easy since python3 is used. Additionally, add some
tests with pytest perhaps.

** DONE Add rustic open new project on creation
CLOSED: [2019-07-12 Fri 20:38]
** TODO Use this to test program
https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vahidk.tensorflow-snippets
** TODO Recreate this with helm and ivy interface
https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rubbersheep.gi
** TODO Create a snippet converter
Create a CLI program which converts snippets from one text editor format to another. Emacs and vim are fairly similar. vscode uses json. Sublime and Visual Studio seem to use xml to define theirs. A large problem will be resolving/detecting tab stops and converting any advanced functionality. 

- The visual studio snippets look like a mess where there is a variety of fields which might be hard to port accross editors. 
- Sublime on the other hand seem more tame.
** CANCELED Create an emacs interface to googler
