* Git Cheat Sheet
** Local Repo to pre-made github repo
When pushing a local repo to a pre-made remote one, we need to set the address of the remote one first
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :results output raw
  git remote add origin #LINKTOREPO
#+END_SRC

To check if everything is correct, we use the following:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :results output raw
  git remote -v
#+END_SRC

Finally, we have to merge the two repos together before we can push(this is if the repo is initialized with a license or a description)
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :results output raw
  # Git will refuse to merge since the two histories are unrelated.
  # This means that the head of the different branches do not match in any way
  git pull origin master --allow-unrelated-histories
#+END_SRC
